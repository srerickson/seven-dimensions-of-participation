    "comment": "Mozilla is the custodian of the Mozilla Public License (\"MPL\"), an open source/free software license developed when Mozilla was still associated with Netscape in 1998. The license has been altered several times and as of 2012 is in version 2.0. The license itself was developed through drafting and commentary from the community. The license reconciles some copyleft provisions with traditional intellectual property law: it is theoretically possible to copyright derivative products, but, in many cases, products significantly derived from Mozilla code must be shared.",
