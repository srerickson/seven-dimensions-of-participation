It also enables software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features. Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Using Tor protects you against a common form of Internet surveillance known as \"traffic analysis.\" Traffic analysis can be used to infer who is talking to whom over a public network. Knowing the source and destination of your Internet traffic allows others to track your behavior and interests\"\r\n\r\n\"Ongoing trends in law, policy, and technology threaten anonymity as never before, undermining our ability to speak and read freely online. These trends also undermine national security and critical infrastructure by making communication among individuals, organizations, corporations, and governments more vulnerable to analysis. Each new user and relay provides additional diversity, enhancing Tor's ability to put control over your security and privacy back into your hands.\"",

  "history": "Tor grew out of Dingeldine's interest in anonymous communication and civil liberties (Erickson, personal communication on IRC). Dingeldine's masters thesis project at MIT was the Freehaven project (http://freehaven.net/). Freehaven is no longer developed because, as the website reads, there are unsolved problems that need to be addressed for it to be robust. For example: \"There is no anonymous communications infrastructure.\"\r\n\r\nTor represents Digneldine's attempt to build the Internet's missing anonymous communications infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe official version of Tor's history from the project website: \"Tor was originally designed, implemented, and deployed as a third-generation onion routing project of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. It was originally developed with the U.S. Navy in mind, for the primary purpose of protecting government communications. Today, it is used every day for a wide variety of purposes by normal people, the military, journalists, law enforcement officers, activists, and many others.\"\r\n\r\nHistory of Licensing from source code:\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2001-2004, Roger Dingledine\r\nCopyright (c) 2004-2006, Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson\r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2011, The Tor Project, Inc.\r\n",

  "resource": "The principal resource that the Tor project provides is the Tor onion router – a piece of open source software that encrypts and redirects your computer's internet traffic through a series of volunteer \"relays\" in order to make it difficult for eaves-dropper to determine what you are doing online (e.g., who you are communicating with). The software is used to both secure your own internet communications and to relay the traffic of other Tor users. \r\n\r\nBy using Tor in \"relay mode,\" you add one more node to the Tor network (the network of all current Tor relays) through which encrypted traffic can be routed. This volunteer/participant-created network for anonymizing Internet communications is a secondary resource associated with the project. The more people use To, the larger the network, and the more security the software provides.",
