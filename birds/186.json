  "history": "Kiva began as a direct microfinance loan site in 2005.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 it began partnering with microlending field banks they deemed \"Field Partners\" to facilitate the loan process.\r\n\r\nFor a timeline of events, see http://www.kiva.org/about/history",
  "lifespan": "Still active as of 2012.",
  "resource": "The resource for the OP is a platform for more engaged philanthropy. Kiva provides a personal connection - donors are able to see photos of individual lenders and receive updates on the projects they fund.  Investors log on to Kiva, view profiles of low-income entrepreneurs and make payments via PayPal to the recipient of their choice. While some of the loans accrue interest, most are simply paid back over the next year. A person can join in with other donors to give a $500, 18-month loan to a farmer in Cambodia to buy more pigs, and get email reports of the monthly repayments, which often provide details of the borrower's progress.",
  "availability": "Anyone can donate. \r\n\r\nKiva also has an extensive privacy policy: http://www.kiva.org/legal/privacy\r\n\r\n\"When you create an account on the site, Kiva collects basic information through the registration process â€“ your name, email address and also tracks information on donations.\"\r\n\r\n ",
  "participation": "Goals, set in Kiva's mission statement, are to get lenders the loan they need by connecting with donors around the world. OPs are likely not directly involved in Kiva's goal settings.",
  "tasks": "Investors log on to Kiva and make a donation via PayPal to the recipient of their choice. \r\n\r\nThere are also interactive features on the website for writing comments (on a Kiva blog, message board or volunteer forum). Lenders can also make updates and provide personal details on their lender page. You can also volunteer as an editor and translator for at least two hours per week editing, translating, and reviewing loan profiles for the Kiva website.",
  "modularity": "Lowest level of involvement would be donating $25. Higher levels of investment would be to join a Lending Team or volunteer as a translator or editor.",
  "granularity": "As granular as making a Paypal donation.",
  "metrics": "Tasks aren't so much measured - each donation would be a completed task.",

Kiva's innovation was to pair an online donation system with social networking, providing profiles for borrowers, lenders, and field partners (local microfinance institutions).
