  "foritself": "Yes. It is self-aware as an entity and promotes a sense of belonging by maintaining active channels of communication (mailing lists, IRC server with servers dedicated to several aspects of the system, as well as a yearly international conference \"Debconf\", generally sponsored for debian active developers around the world). It has very distinct ways of selecting participants (debian new maintainer process) and promoting membership (by active sponsoring of new developers). Clear distinction between contributors (free software packagers) and developers (debuggers and people responsible for the quality of the packages that are included in the system) is maintained. \r\n\r\nAnother distinctive feature of Debian is a clear process of governance and coordination of the development work: they hold elections for the selection of their \"leader\". They abide to a Social Contract (which specifies the nature of the project and what is to be expected from it) and a Free Software Definition (which serves as a guideline on what to include and exclude from the distribution).",

  "history": "Ian Murdock founded Debian GNU/Linux in 1993 (while he was a computer science undergrad at Purdue University). For 1994-95, the project was sponsored by Free Software Foundation. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, Bruce Perens became the leader of Debian and laid the foundations for project: started Software in Public Interest (an FSE to sponsor Debian), created the Debian Free Software Guidelines, Debian Social Contract and the Open Hardware Project.\r\n\r\nDebconf (a tool for package management) was created in 1996 and became the most sophisticated package systems, increasing the popularity of Debian enormously. \r\n\r\nBruce Perens left the project in 1998. \r\n\r\nIn 2000 the project made many changes to both release management and archive management. July 2002 saw the release of version 3.0. \r\n 3.1 was released in 2005 and has almost twice the amount of software included in previous releases. \r\nIn 2006 Mozilla software was rebranded in Debian due to disputes over branding and copyright. \r\nDebian 4.0 was released in 2007 with Debian 5.0 arriving in 2009 and the current version 6.0 was released in February of 2011. \r\n \r\n(Accessed September 7, 2012: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian#1993.E2.80.931998)\r\n\r\n",

  "modularity": "This varies depending on the task the volunteer chooses. At the beginning stages of participation, new participants are encouraged to engaged in a range of tasks including website maintenance and translation. After devoting some time to familiarizing oneself with the guidelines, expectations and general community ethics of Debian, one can apply to become either a Debian Maintainer (DM) or a Debian Developer (DD). \r\nDebian Maintainer (DM): The first step in which you can upload your own packages to the Debian archive yourself.\r\nDebian Developer (DD): The traditional full membership role in Debian. A DD can upload any package and can participate in Debian elections. Before applying as DD, you should have been a DM for about six months.\r\n\r\nThe task modularity then is relative. \r\n",
