  "formation": "OP to FSE. Dries Buyaert started Drupal around 1998-1999. It began as an internal message board when Buyaert was a computer science doctoral student. Later, it transformed into an online messageboard, then a  website, then, finally, a software release. \r\n\r\nAs the software gained popularity, Buyaert, Dries Knapen, and Steven Wittens were stewarding the project. Based on community input and research in the open source community, The Drupal Association was incorporated as Drupal VZW, a non-profit foundation chartered in the Netherlands. An American non-profit, DrupalCon, Inc., formed in 2009 to assist in the organization of the annual conference. In 2011, DrupalCon. Inc. formally assumed the business name \"Drupal Association\" and began acting as the recognized legal body charged with supporting the development and maintenance of Drupal.\r\n",
  "history": "In 2000, permanent Internet connections were at a premium for University of Antwerp students, so Dries Buytaert and Hans Snijder set up a wireless bridge between their student dorms to share Hans's ADSL modem connection among eight students. While this was an extremely luxurious situation at that time, something was missing: There was no means to discuss or share simple things.\r\n\r\nThis inspired Dries to work on a small news site with a built-in web board, allowing the group of friends to leave each other notes about the status of the network, to announce where they were having dinner, or to share some noteworthy news items.\r\n\r\nThe software did not have a name until the day after Dries moved out after graduation. The group decided to put the internal website online so they could stay in touch, keep sharing interesting findings, and narrate snippets of their personal lives. While looking for a suitable domain name, Dries settled for 'drop.org' after he made a typo to see if the name 'dorp.org' was still available. Dorpje is the Dutch word for \"village,\" which was considered a fitting name for the small community.\r\n\r\nOnce drop.org was established on the Web, its audience changed as the members began talking about new web technologies, such as moderation, syndication, rating, and distributed authentication. Drop.org slowly turned into a personal experimentation environment, driven by the discussions and flow of ideas. The discussions about these web technologies were tried out on drop.org itself as new additions to the software running the site.\r\n\r\nIt was only later, in January 2001, that Dries decided to release the software behind drop.org as \"Drupal.\" The purpose was to enable others to use and extend the experimentation platform so that more people could explore new paths for development. The name Drupal, pronounced \"droo-puhl,\" derives from the English pronunciation of the Dutch word \"druppel,\" which means \"drop.\"\r\n\r\nTo view a complete list of changes to the software since it's initial release, see http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/CHANGELOG.txt/7/source.

  "resource": "The main resource provided is the free, open-source content management system (CMS), Drupal.

  "tasks": "Community participation is actively encouraged. At the global level, Dries Buyaert is referred to by his first name, and the yearly DrupalCon traditionally welcomes and encourages diversity, familiarity, and originality. \r\n\r\nAt the local level, Drupal meetups happen regularly in many cities around the world, and local Drupal communities attach their own pages and organizational materials to the larger Drupal groups site. \r\n\r\nMeetup organizers usually tag their profiles with their actual photographs and real names. Drupal mailing lists are actively contributed to. \r\n\r\nThe Drupal IRC channel is always open, and a useful resource for site development questions, ranging from \"What is wrong with this PHP?\" to \"Where is the next meetup in Los Angeles?\" to \"Check out this module I just made and help me work out the bugs.\"\r\n\r\nThe forums and comments at Drupal.org and its manifestations are usually friendly and helpful. Snarkiness is generally looked upon as bad form, though blind participation (such as asking a question that has already been answered) can be frowned upon, and on a related note, the level of technical known-how required to contribute to the forums and comments is higher than your average Google user. \r\n\r\n\"Community.\" Drupal.org. n.d. http://drupal.org/community.

  "modularity": "The Drupal Community tasks are described as \"using, building, and supporting,\" the Drupal project.\r\n\r\nWhile those with a medium to high level of technical expertise should be able to complete tasks via a \"learn by doing\" mentality, those with low levels of technical expertise can be confused by the concepts and tasks required to create a Drupal site. \r\n\r\nHowever, once this basic technical skill set and know-how is acquired, community participation, theming, developing, and module-writing becomes - like the development of most technologies - a matter of time and debugging.\r\n\r\nAnd with that said, because of Drupal's participatory ethos and the Drupal project's extensive documentation, Drupal is sometimes used as a pedagogical resource for technical skill development.

  "summary": "Drupal is a free, open-source open source content management system used at a number of high profile websites. Drupal emerged rather organically as an effort of a very small group of founders and early enthusiasts and only formed an FSE later to manage the growth of the software: since 2011, the Drupal Association has been the legal body charged with supporting the worldwide Drupal community. \r\n\r\nDrupal runs on over a million sites, including WhiteHouse.gov, World Economic Forum, Stanford University, and Examiner.com. Drupal‚Äôs default installation is a database-backed web platform with file maintenance tools and a high level of security. Many developers take advantage of Drupal‚Äôs extensible architecture to go far beyond the ‚Äúcore‚Äù package. Drupal is a multi-user system, letting site visitors log in (as ‚Äúauthenticated‚Äù users) or browse the site without doing so (as ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù users). Administrators control permissions, and can also assign ‚Äúroles‚Äù for multiple permission levels.\r\n\r\nDrupal site designs come from ‚Äúthemes‚Äù, whose visual presentation is described in standard CSS. Drupal.org hosts hundreds of free, fully customizable themes, including several ‚Äúbase themes.‚Äù Hundreds of volunteers contribute code to Drupal's core, and many thousands more contribute themes, ad-ons, and extensions for the platform. Drupal is licensed through the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later, which requires that derivative products be distributed under the same terms of the original Drupal code. Drupal developers collaborate online and meet at an annual conference or any number of smaller regional conferences.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.acquia.com/what-is-drupal.
