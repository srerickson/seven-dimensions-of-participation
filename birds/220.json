  "brand": "The icon of a half-red, half-black star is indicative of the political inclinations of the collective that runs the project. The black portion of the star symbolizes anarchism while the red symbolizes communism, and the equal bisection of the two colours represents the co-existence of anarchist and socialist ideals within the anarcho-syndicalist movement. \r\n(Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_symbolism#Bisected_flags_and_stars)\r\n",

  "op_typical_member": "Contributors to the site are united by ideology, namely that of libertarian communism and syndicalist variants of anarchism. The libcom group's political orientation is articulated in their own words on their \"about\" page: \r\n\r\n\"We identify primarily with the trends of workers' solidarity, co-operation and struggle throughout history, whether they were self-consciously libertarian communist (such as in the Spanish revolution) or not. We are also influenced by certain specific theoretical and practical traditions, such as anarchist-communism, anarcho-syndicalism, the ultra-left, left communism, libertarian Marxism, council communism and others. We have sympathies with writers and organisations including Karl Marx, Gilles Dauv√©, Maurice Brinton, Wildcat Germany, Anarchist Federation, Solidarity Federation, prole.info, Aufheben, Solidarity, the situationists, Spanish CNT and others.\"\r\n(source: http://libcom.org/notes/about)\r\n\r\nWhile centered in the UK, there is a significant proportion of contributors from continental Europe and the Americas, and a growing amount of content related to struggles in Africa. This is representative of the global mindset of the typical user, who is likely to have an aversion towards all forms of nationalism. ",
  "formation": "The libcom group had originally formed through a site called enrager.net, turning into libcom officially in 2005. The OP developed in response to the content put out by the FSE, then eventually had the opportunity to submit its own content starting in 2006. The current rendition of the site features submitted content from the OP interweaved seamlessly with content from the FSE. ",
  "history": "\"A quick rundown of libcom.org's website history.\r\n\r\nSite history\r\nv.4.1 - March 2007 - A major upgrade of the Drupal infrastructure for the site and a new look.\r\nv.4 - Summer 2006 - We went web2.0, the entire site is ported into Drupal giving greater control and interactivity.\r\nv.3 - May 2005 - we renamed the site libcom.org and added new sections (library) as well as updating old content.\r\nv.2 - May 2004 - the re-design, dumping the dull grey and going for a more accessible, easy-read site adding the history section.\r\nv.1 - September 2003 - our public launch, when we adopted a grey/white format and hit the world with our ideas and the project.\r\nv.0 - October 2002 - enrager.net is founded: a personal site hosting a couple of texts and some pictures.\"\r\n(Source: http://libcom.org/library/site-history)\r\n\r\nA recent site redesign was implemented on May 1, 2012 (Source: http://libcom.org/blog/libcomorg-unveils-new-theme-01052012)",

  "participation": "To use the old radical catchphrase, the purpose of the site appears to be to \"educate, agitate, organise\", as well as to provide news and resources for activists of the anarchist-communist persuasion. The forums also provide a platform wherein participants can work out ideas, debate, seek advice, etc.\r\n\r\nThe FSE has fundamentally set the goals by establishing the parameters of submitted content, but the OP plays an active role in determining the content itself by submitting and discussing their own articles and blog posts. ",
  "tasks": "Users can contribute to the project by posting and tagging articles they've written or writing in their own blogs hosted by the site. The guidelines for article content submission are set by the FSE, indicating a general direction for the site has been set and users are expected to conform to those standards:\r\n\r\n\"\"If you've registered on libcom.org, you can post content to our news. There are particular kinds of articles we want most, and some obviously that we don't so much. But don't worry, if we can't use something on our news page we will look at any other areas of the site where it might be suitable, or we may edit it to make it fit in....\" (Source: http://libcom.org/notes/help-out/content/news-posting-guidelines)\r\n\r\n\"For libcom.org news the main kinds of article we want are as follows, in this order of importance:\r\n\r\n1. Stories and analysis about people taking collective direct action to improve their lives.\r\nExample: Fighting the fare hike in San Francisco \r\n2. Analysis of current events, such as wars, natural disasters and other big mainstream news stories from a class perspective.\r\nExample: Post Office privatisation will be disguised as workers' ownership \r\n3. News about the effects of corporate and government policies on people and the environment.\r\nExample: 12 million trapped in forced labour worldwide\r\n\r\nWhile these are our priorities we will happily publish other news stories provided they fit the aims and ethos of the site with the general exception of the following topics:\r\n\r\nActions: There are many websites for 'activists' to post stories about 'actions' they have taken part in, such as indymedia. We suggest using one of them instead of libcom.\r\nExample: \"Activists blockade Esso station\"\r\n\r\nThe left: Leninist groups are a minor irrelevance in society who do not interest anyone. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, let's not give them any attention they don't warrant.\r\nExample: \"Trotskyist Workers' Alliance split\"\r\n\r\nPromotion: If you would like to advertise an event, group or campaign please use the announcements board on our forums.\" (Source: http://libcom.org/notes/help-out/content/news-posting-guidelines)\r\n\r\nUsers may also participate in the forums and comment on articles written by others.\r\n\r\nMore details on tasks from libcom's \"help out!\" section:\r\n\r\n\"Publicity: Spreading the word about the site, linking to it or to particular section/articles from your own website, blog etc. is always appreciated! Share articles on social networking sites such as Facebook, twitter and social bookmarking sites like digg and stumbleupon. A great way to spread libcom's services and bring people great content is to syndicate content from our site - see our RSS feeds at the bottom of each index.\r\n\r\nWe also encourage people to add links to our content on relevant pages on online discussion forums, newspaper comment sections and editable websites. For instance, libcom.org hosts many historical texts that can be used as evidence citations for assertions made on various Wikipedia pages or listed in the external links sections. We do not encourage spamming, but only relevant placement where it might enrich content or discussions.\r\n\r\nFinancial: This is always useful, as we need money to pay our host, and also pay for advertising like leaflets etc. With our upgrade our hosting costs have increased 20-fold, so donations are especially appreciated. You can donate to us here.\r\n\r\nTechnical: We aren't super geeks. We are always looking for people to help us with technical tasks, or even just advise us on stuff we don't understand. Current projects - making more of the site database driven, setting up our own server, creating a mirror of the site. If you have technological wizardry, please let us know how you can help or ask us for more info.\r\n\r\nMirroring content: Websites can go offline unannounced anytime, so if you can have articles from our site up on yours (with a reference link to us too) then that can help assure that the information will always be available. Also if you would be able to mirror our entire site please contact us\"\r\n\r\nStill more, from the same page:\r\n\"Edit: If you spot any errors on our site, like typos or wrong dates, or if you see an article which could be formatted better or have additional hyperlinks to related texts please edit it. See our guidelines on editing articles. We would also like people to add relevant images to any articles that lack them. Edits then go in to a moderation queue. If you don't feel confident editing directly, post a comment to let us know about the error.\r\n\r\nSubmit content: The more quality information the site holds, the better a resource it is. You can help with the content of the site in two ways ‚Äì either whenever you have a spare moment or by becoming a regular contributor. We are happy for any and all contributions. However, for interested parties we do have a style guide with information about the main kind of content, focus and tone we are aiming for.\r\n\r\nNews ‚Äì write, find, edit and submit news regularly to keep it up-to-date and provide a quality resource for libertarian news and analysis. Adopt-a-source - if you help out with, or particularly like one publication or website you can take responsibility for posting all relevant news from it to our site.\r\n\r\nTopics ‚Äì adopt a feature - if there is a particular topic you are interested in, such as ID Cards, say, we can help set up a feature page and give you access to it to keep it updated\r\n\r\nLibrary ‚Äì become a libcom librarian! Find obscure or interesting articles, books and documents and make them available to all. We have a wish list of sites we want to archive here, take a quick look and if you have 10 minutes here or there, post an article across.\r\n\r\nAnything else ‚Äì if you want to help out with any other sections on a regular basis email us and we can sort something out.\r\n\r\nArt and design \r\nIf you have artistic or design skills, and would like to help out with our site, we would love to hear from you. Please send us an e-mail.\" (Source: http://libcom.org/notes/help-out)",
  "modularity": "Modularity is variable depending on the task being performed. For instance, submitting articles to be featured on the site or creating pdfs to be uploaded to the library presumably takes more time, research, and preparation than posting on the forum.\r\n\r\nThere are two tiers for those who would like to submit content: \r\n\"Occasional: We particularly desire articles written from a libertarian class struggle perspective of between 400 and 2,000 words for the news, history and library sections. Have a browse through the section for important ideas which are missing or pages which could be improved on. Please also feel free to write and submit your own news to our news page, post up interesting stories you have found elsewhere, or scan texts which you have access to. For any interesting articles you have which don‚Äôt look like they fit anywhere, there‚Äôs always our library.\r\n\r\nRegular: If you want to and have the time, you can become one of our contributors. Contributors have access to additional site functions like personal blogs, and can take responsibility for several different areas of the site\" (Source: http://libcom.org/notes/help-out)\r\n\r\nThe range of members who contribute to the forums appears to be wider than those who contribute articles, possibly indicating a lower cost of entry.",
