  "history": "The german company StarDivision created a office suite for the UNIX platform. The office suite was bought by Sun Microsystems in 1999, and renamed OpenOffice. Due to strong control of the contributions to the codebase, a group of OpenOffice developers created a fork called Go-ooo.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Oracle bought Sun Microsystems. The Document Foundation was founded in order to create an alternative to OpenOffice, based on the Go-ooo fork. The biggest fear was that Oracle would stop supporting OpenOffice. The Document Foundation also wanted to open to contribution by Free and Open Source developers from community projects, who had allegedly their patches and contributions rejected by Sun Microsystems (which target the corporate market for the OpenOffice suite). \r\n",
