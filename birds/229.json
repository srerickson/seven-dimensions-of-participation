  "foritself": "Yes. In a sense, awareness of  community and local places is what Foursquare offers. Foursquare encourages users to think of the service as a game, so participation here connotes play and leisure. Like other social networks, people who are friends offline interact with each other within the space of the app, but the app does afford the opportunity to interact with previously unknown people. Participants have no say in the FSE's goals, the setting of tasks, or the disposition of data created, nor do they gain any educational dividend.",
  "brand": "Foursquare's logo uses white and off-white sans-serif type, outlined in blue over a blue field.  Company materials always use lower case to refer to the company. The logo is relatively traditional and typical of corporate graphic design. The site also uses cartoon-like illustrations that are more colorful for its badges, virtual medals that reward users for a particular set or quantity of check-ins. The badges and the copy for the site tend to be playful and present the app as a game. Foursquare's website also contain a kind of style guide that dictates \"check-in\" as a noun and \"check in\" as a verb.",

  "history": "Foursquare is a New York-based start-up that promotes an eponymous smartphone app, which is essentially a geo-referenced, crowdsourced database of places. Foursquare was founded in 2009 by Dennis Crowley and Naveen Selvadurai. The two previously created an SMS-based social network called Dodgeball, which was acquired by Google in 2005 and subsequently deactivated.  Foursquare allows users to check in to places that have been identified in Foursquare's databases, such as restaurants, bars, public parks, or any other user-added location.  The system records the user's check-in data, capturing the geographic and temporal coordinates via the phone's location-aware capabilities. Foursquare presents itself as a game: users share locations with friends, collect accomplishments called badges for a particular variety or quantity of check-ins, and share location data via other social networks. \r\n\r\nAccording to Crowley, since 2009 the company has collected more than two billion pieces of data about its 20 million users. Despite initial enthusiasm and media attention, the company has yet to generate any income. As of 2012, the company changed direction, hoping to leverage its store of data to become a recommendation and review hub or to provide access to its locations database to other apps and services. Many of Foursquareâ€™s early competitors, including Loopt, Gowalla, Whrrl, Brightkite and Hot Potato have stopped operating, leaving Foursquare in an advantageous, if not lucrative, position.\r\n\r\nWortham, J.
