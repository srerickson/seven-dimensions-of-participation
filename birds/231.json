  "summary": "Tumblr is a microblogging site that allows users to publish text, pictures, links, video, and combinations of these media to individual blogs easily. Users interact with others via a shared communicative space, the Dashboard. Tumblr lacks common social media conventions by design, such as comments or any display of the number of followers a given user has. Despite an $800 million valuation, Tumblr has yet to generate income, recent forays into paid advertising notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nTumblr was founded by David Karp, a young engineer and entrepreneur who had worked for the site UrbanBaby.com. He hired Marco Arment to develop a microblogging platform and launched Tumblr in 2007. The company acquired a smaller concern in order to create an iPhone app. Tumblr, although popular and marketed as a creative tool, is largely the vision of its founder, David Karp. Users do not contribute code, except as templates for blogs (themes). Particiaption in Tumblr amounts to posting orignal works, curating work form other blogs, or viewing content curated by others. Unlike many other social media platforms, Tumblr does not claim ownership of content created on its platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/magazine/can-tumblrs-david-karp-embrace-ads-without-selling-out.html?pagewanted=all.
