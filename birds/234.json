  "foritself": "It is self aware - Pinterest is based on the concept of pinning, repinning and attributing posts of interest. I would not say that there is a fostered sense of belonging, as it is more about commerce and status and the barrier for participation is so low. Pinning and repinning items does not convey any kind of meaningful connection between users but can be used to follow fashion or commercial trends. ",
  "brand": "The Pinterest logo is very simple, fluid and understated. It remains simple and tends to take a backseat to the splashier visual style of the site itself, which necessitates multiple views and patterns in order to function. The visual identity of Pinterest itself is characterized by a collage style process, a virtual imitation of the analog pinboard. ",

In December 2011, it became one of the top ten largest social network services according to HItwise data. \r\n\r\nAccording to Ben Silbermann's presentation at the 2012 South by Southwest Interactive conference, new profile pages are in development and will be implemented soon.

  "summary": "Pinterest is a social photo-sharing website that is based on the visual metaphor of a pin board. It allows users to create pinboards around themes, expressing their shared interest with others and referring resources. Users can browse others pin boards, re-pin images to their own pin boards, create content or just \"like\" photos. \r\nPinterest is a for profit endeavour, run by Cold Brew Labs which is supported through individual as well as corporate investors. In its short lifespan it has gained notoriety, launched apps for the iPhone and iPad as well as inspired the development of an Android app. \r\nThe user demographics suggest that the typical Pinterest user is a young, wealthy mother. \r\n\r\nAdditional reading: \r\nDesai, Nihit. \"Online Social Networks as Markov Chains: measuring Influence in the Pinterest Community,\" (https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/nhdesai2/www/project_CS512.pdf.)\r\n\r\nDudenhoffer, Cynthia. \"Pinterest as a Library Marketing and Information Literacy Tool,\" College and Research Libraries Nwes vol. 73 no. 6 June 2012. \r\n\r\nGoreczky, Sophia. \"Human-computer Interaction Concepts Applied to the Web Interface, Pinterest,\" Dissertation prepared for Penny Beebe in the Engineering Communications Program for the Department of Computer Science  at Cornell.\r\n\r\nThere are any number of articles, websites and books dedicated to using PInterest to promote your business or corporate interests.
