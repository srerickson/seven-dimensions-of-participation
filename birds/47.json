  "history": "Kaltura was founded in the fall of 2006 by Ron Yekutiel (CEO as of 2008), Dr. Shay David (VP of Community and Business Development as of 2008), Dr. Michal Tsur (a co-founder of Cyota, President and COO as of 2008) and Eran Etam (a co-founder of ICQ, Kaltura's CTO as of 2008).[2]\r\nKaltura was launched at the TechCrunch40 industry event in San Francisco on September 18, 2007, and won the Peopleâ€™s Choice award based on a vote of the conference's attendees.[3] At that time, the company had 20 employees, and had received 2.1 million dollars in funding from business angels and Californian VC fund Avalon Ventures.[3]\r\nOn December 21, 2007, Kaltura won the Peopleâ€™s Choice award (over 250,000 users participated in voting) in the Video Sharing category for the Mashable Open Web Awards.[4] Also in 2007, Kaltura began a partnership with the New York Public Library, whose team was headed by Joshua Greenberg. In 2008, Kaltura was selected as one of the \"Global 250 Winners\" by AlwaysOn.[5] Kaltura CEO and cofounder Ron Yekutiel was photographed for the article \"The Suit, Vers. 3.0\" in Esquire Magazine's July 2008 edition.[6]\r\nIn January 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation and Kaltura announced that they had begun a collaboration aimed at bringing rich-media collaboration to Wikipedia and other wiki websites.[7] The technology behind this project is a form of video-wiki software (open source and still in beta) that is integrated into the Mediawiki platform as an extension, allowing users to add collaborative video players that enable all users to add and edit images, sounds, diagrams, animations and movies in the same manner as they do today with text.\r\nKaltura was a sponsor of the Wikimania 2008 event, where it announced that it is sponsoring Michael Dale, an open source video developer, to support the further development of a 100% open source video editing solution integrated into MediaWiki.[8]\r\nIn addition to support of MediaWiki, Kaltura enables interactive videos integrated within popular CMS and blogging platforms such as WordPress.\r\nKaltura is also a founder of the Open Video Alliance, a group of organizations, academics, artists and entrepreneurs, geared towards promoting open standards for video on the web.\r\n[edit]",
